# 📄 Resume Generator — Aaron Demby Jones

Welcome to my resume repository!

This project explores the intersection of:

- Generative identity formation
- Surreal UX rituals
- Late-capitalist compliance theater

## 🧠 Features

- ⚙️ **Autofill Mode** — Instantly generates a resume from curated template fragments.
- 🧪 **Residual Selfhood Score** — Tracks how many times the user has pressed "autofill" to assess remaining autonomy.
- 📊 **Compliance Scanner** — Optional scan to check for corporate buzzword density and affective tone mismatches.
- 🌀 **Chaos Engine (WIP)** — Injects randomized truth leaks into sanitized language (e.g., "led team" → "absorbed structural inertia").

## 💬 Philosophy

> "I used to spend hours pretending to be confident. Now I just press a button."

Real experiences were harmed in the making of this file.

## 📎 Usage
