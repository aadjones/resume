**Capitalism Survival Guide: Survival Resume Generator**

---

## **1\. Product Summary**

The Survival Resume Generator is a satirical tool within the broader _Capitalism Survival Guide_ portal.  
 It allows users to generate dystopian, survivalist resumes based on the unspoken realities of different industries, exposing the emotional and systemic realities hidden behind traditional resume formats.

The generator produces resumes that look superficially professional but reveal the transactional, hollow, or brutal values actually demanded by late capitalist labor systems.

## **2\. Target Users**

- **Primary:**

  - Disillusioned workers across tech, service, healthcare sectors.

  - People seeking catharsis or dark humor about work and survival.

- **Secondary:**

  - Artists, writers, activists interested in capitalist critique.

  - General internet users looking for satirical novelty.

---

## **3\. Problem Statement**

Modern resumes are sanitized artifacts that mask the survival demands placed on workers.  
 There is no existing tool that allows users to see â€” and playfully survive â€” the **true, hidden emotional economics** of job survival under capitalism.
